The Kent System has been based on a preivous visualization system combining Euler diagrams and graphs [VLC]. The system parses two text files containing the group structure and a list of edges. Once complete, a websocket is used to recieve the Euler diagram layout from a remote server running the iCircles software [iCircles]. When the layout is returned, it is drawn on screen. The largest area within each region is then found (represented by green rectangles), and the nodes are drawn in a grid pattern within this region [inital.svg]. The Euler diagram is then modified to provide a better layout. The location of each circles is moved and the current layout is compared to the previous best. The fitness score, used to determine if a layout is better, is a combination of the the distance between two connected regions and a rating of the size of each region (the current size is comapred to an "ideal" size, which is dependent on the number of nodes the particular region contains). Once the best layout has been determined [afterSearch.svg], a force-directed layout is run on the nodes. This is a standard spring embedder, with the exception that nodes have a repulsion force away from the arcs of each circle. Nodes are not allowed to leave their region, but may move from the starting rectangle. This ensures that nodes do not change group, nor cluster on the inside of circles. Once the force-directed layout is complete [final.svg]. The colour of each set is determined by choosing from the ColorBrewer set, and this helps to
